		"reasoning": "This is a valid feature request for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the UX Sitemap Visualizer application. After thoroughly analyzing the codebase, I found:\n\n1. **No existing RBAC implementation**: The codebase currently has no authentication, authorization, role management, or permission system. Searches for \"role\", \"permission\", \"owner\", \"admin\", \"member\", \"viewer\", \"auth\", \"user\", \"middleware\", \"guard\", and \"policy\" yielded no relevant results in the source code (only ARIA role-related matches from testing libraries and one hook about tree navigation).\n\n2. **Frontend-only application**: The codebase is currently a React-based client-side library for visualizing sitemaps/tree structures. There is no backend/server code, no API layer, and no database infrastructure. The `package.json` shows only frontend dependencies (React, D3, Vite, etc.).\n\n3. **Feature request is technically feasible**: Implementing RBAC would require significant new infrastructure including:\n   - Backend/API layer for authentication and authorization\n   - Database schema for users, roles, and permissions\n   - Permission enforcement at API and database levels\n   - Frontend components for role-based UI rendering\n\n4. **Clear scope**: The issue clearly defines four roles (owner, admin, member, viewer) and mentions both API and database level enforcement, making it an actionable feature request.\n\nThis is a new feature request that would add authentication and authorization capabilities to what is currently a stateless visualization library.",

		"suggestedFix": "To implement RBAC, the following would be needed:\n\n1. **Add backend infrastructure**: Create a server (Node.js/Express, etc.) with API endpoints for authentication and resource access.\n\n2. **Database layer**: Add a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) with tables/collections for:\n   - Users (id, email, password hash, etc.)\n   - Roles (owner, admin, member, viewer)\n   - Permissions (fine-grained actions like create, read, update, delete sitemaps)\n   - User-Role assignments\n   - Resource-Permission mappings\n\n3. **API middleware**: Implement authentication middleware (JWT/session-based) and authorization middleware that checks role-based permissions before allowing API access.\n\n4. **Frontend integration**: Add authentication context/hooks, protected routes, and conditional UI rendering based on user roles.\n\n5. **Database-level security**: Implement row-level security policies (if using PostgreSQL) or application-level query restrictions based on user permissions.",
